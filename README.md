# The Supermarket Receipt Refactoring Kata

On this branch, the exercise is to incrementally add changes, running the tests after each one. The end state should be the same as the branch 'with_broken_tests', you just get there in small steps.

To apply each incremental change, use these commands:

    git apply 0001-pick-1.patch
    git apply 0001-pick-2.patch
    git apply 0001-pick-3.patch
    git apply 0001-pick-4.patch
    git apply 0001-pick-5.patch
    git apply 0001-pick-6.patch
