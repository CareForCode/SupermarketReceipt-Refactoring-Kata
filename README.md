# The Supermarket Receipt Refactoring Kata

On this branch, the exercise is to incrementally add changes, running the tests after each one. The end state should be the same as the branch 'with_broken_tests', you just get there in small steps.

To apply each incremental change, use these commands:

    git apply pick1.patch
    git apply pick2.patch
    git apply pick3.patch
    git apply pick4.patch
    git apply pick5.patch
    git apply pick6.patch
